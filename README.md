Modeling and simulating an integrated petroleum production system in Excel can be a demanding 
and time-consuming task. In the following project a Python application has been developed to
streamline this process. The application is to function as a platform for investigation, modeling,
and simulation tasks pertaining to integrated petroleum production systems.
The application is equipped with computational routines tailored to estimate production profiles
and assess reservoir depletion for gas fields. Moreover, it incorporates the capability to access and
analyze open data sourced from the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), providing insights
into hydrocarbon fields located on the Norwegian continental shelf.
