Modeling and simulating an integrated petroleum production system in Excel can be a demanding 
and time-consuming task. An application has been developed in Python using Streamlit to offer computational
routines to streamline this process. The application is to function as a platform for investigation, modeling,
and simulation tasks regarding integrated petroleum production systems.

The application is equipped with computational routines tailored to estimate production profiles, analyze NPV, 
optimize field development variables, and run uncertainty analysis. Furthermore, it can be utilized to assess reservoir depletion 
for gas fields and run Monte Carlo Simulation to simulate aggregated probability distributions. Moreover, it incorporates the 
capability to access and analyze open data on petroleum activities on the Norwegian Continental Shelf. 
The data is publicly made available by the Norwegian Offshore Directorate (Sodir). The implemented functionality can be used to gain
insights into production volumes and water cuts, and project future trends through curve fit analysis for all fields on the Norwegian
Continental Shelf. It also offers functionality to display the areal extension of the reservoir(s), with the placement of all wells.
